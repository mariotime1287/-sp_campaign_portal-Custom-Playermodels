What does this do?
Simple: removes the arbitrary forcepmodels tag from Puchi's Sven Co-op Campaign Portal, which is included in the base mod.

Can other players connect to a server running this without installing or downloading it?
As far as I've tested, yes.

How was this made?
Simple: The original BSP file was opened in a text editor, and "forcepmodels" was changed to the meaningless "forcelmodels".

[b]How is this installed?[/b]
Like every other Sven Co-op addon: placing the BSP file in svencoop_addons/maps/.
